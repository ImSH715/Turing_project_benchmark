"""
The script loads grid and orange tree feautres, and detects if each grids and tree clowns are overriding.
If yes, there are three conditions to make.
1. Based on the boxes (grid is in 3x3 so total 9 boxes), if 3 boxes have a likelihood higher than 0.5.
 - Create center point of those boxes with likelihood higher than 0.5.
2. If not (1-2 boxes with likelihood higher than 0.5, or 1-2 boxes with higher 0.5 and other boxes with likelihood 
(feautres are still detected into those boxes)) create a point (coordinate) on the feature and grid override spot and set their type as slide (coordinates required to slide the grid).
3. If none of the boxes or one boxes has likelihood higher than 0.5, abort them.

Generate the .csv file including or coordinates of type center and slide.
